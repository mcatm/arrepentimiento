  "description": "In the burnt red-black sky, the gospel resonates in capital HELVETICA. At the beach where the sadness ended, preparations for a new party begin. Buildings of sound constructed in fictitious dimensions are now irradiated to the body from completely different angles. A melody is born like breathing, and the rhythm dies as if to breathe out. Let's say goodbye to old-fashioned magic. At the entrance of the mellow cavity era.",
